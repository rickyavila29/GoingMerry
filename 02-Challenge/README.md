Password Generator
* The purpose of this activity was to create a password generator that would randomly compile a certain length of characters based of the selections the user makes in the prompt. 
* As the developer, I made an array of letters, numbers, and special characters to create a selection for the user when generating a new password.
* There a variables in place to collect user input from pompts so later that information can be used when calling functions to execute the generation.
* This challenge was difficult but it showed me how to use objects and what kinds of properties I can give them. Learning to keep my code clean while nesting things was intersting as well. I learned how easy it can make reading your code easier if done properly and how it helps reduce unecessary lines.
* Working with the console was neat whenever I would run my code and be able to find which line the error was on. I learned how to test my code and see the result of booleans and console log the result of my functions. Though console.log is the only method im familiar with, I look foward to exploring other possibilities with the console.
* Overall the assigmnet showed me how tedious javascript can be but also gave me a lot of clarity on the structure.
